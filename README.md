| 2       | Analyzing a packet capture file                         | Wireshark  | N/A       | This was my first time using Wireshark. Initially, the interface was overwhelming, but I can see why it's such a powerful tool for understanding network traffic. |
| 3       | Capturing my first packet                               | tcpdump    | N/A       | Being new to the command-line interface, using tcpdump was challenging. I encountered issues with commands but eventually succeeded by carefully following instructions. |

## Reflections/Notes:

| Question                                                                                             | Response                                                                                                        |

| Were there any specific activities that were challenging for you? Why or why not?                  | The tcpdump activity was challenging due to my inexperience with the command line. Learning the syntax required patience and careful reading of instructions. |
| Has your understanding of incident detection and response changed after taking this course?         | My understanding of incident detection and response has evolved significantly. Initially, I had a basic understanding, but the course highlighted the complexity of the process, including the importance of plans, processes, people, and tools. |
| Was there a specific tool or concept that you enjoyed the most? Why?                                | I enjoyed learning about network traffic analysis and using network protocol analyzer tools. It was a new, challenging, and exciting topic, and I look forward to becoming more proficient in this area. |
